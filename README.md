### R.A.P.T.O.R - Raspberry Pi Automated Traffic Optimization and Response

#### Description:
R.A.P.T.O.R is a system built using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV library for Python, designed to automate traffic monitoring, optimization, and response. It utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze traffic flow, detect vehicles, and optimize traffic signals accordingly.

#### Features:
- **Traffic Monitoring**: R.A.P.T.O.R continuously monitors traffic flow using one or more camera feeds connected to Raspberry Pi.
- **Vehicle Detection**: It detects vehicles in real-time using background subtraction and contour analysis techniques.
- **Automated Response**: Based on traffic conditions, R.A.P.T.O.R can optimize traffic signals to improve traffic flow.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The system provides a simple interface for users to monitor traffic and view statistics.
